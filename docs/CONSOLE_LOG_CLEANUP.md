## What Was Preserved

### ✅ Kept All Error Logging
- `console.error()` statements remain in all files for proper error monitoring
- Error handling and user feedback mechanisms are intact
- Production error tracking is maintained

### ✅ Functional Logging
- Error details for debugging production issues
- Failed transaction information
- Contract interaction errors
- Network and validation errors

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Console**: No more cluttered browser console in production
2. **Better Performance**: Reduced logging overhead
3. **Professional Appearance**: Clean development environment
4. **Maintained Debugging**: Error logs still available for troubleshooting
5. **Production Ready**: Code is now ready for production deployment

## Files That Still Have Console Logs (Intentionally Preserved)

All remaining `console.error()` statements in:
- Error handlers throughout the application
- Failed transaction logging
- Network error reporting
- Validation error tracking

These are essential for production monitoring and debugging real issues.

## Total Console Logs Removed
- **22 `console.log()` statements** removed
- **4 `console.warn()` statements** removed  
- **0 `console.error()` statements** removed (preserved for production)

The application is now clean and production-ready while maintaining proper error logging capabilities!
